For this case study, we're going to walk through the creation of a dice rolling app that has the following user stories and requirements.

## Core User Story
"I want an app to select a number of dice, then roll them and record the result."

## Requirements
<b>Product Requirements</b>
1. The app should allow you to select a number of dice, up to 10 dice.
2. The app should allow you to select the number of sides for each die (6, 8, 10, 12, 20).
3. The app should allow you to display the result of each roll.
4. The app should allow you to log the history of each roll.

<b>Technical Requirements</b>
1. The dice app should be built in React
2. Organization is a nice to have, but this is an MVP so you can do it all in one place
3. You can style it however you wish, but there should be a clear visual representation of a dice

## Time Limit
